This repo is for little useful tools and scripts for doing TA stuff.

sheet_to_comments.py

This is a short Python script which interacts with a Google Spreadsheet. After getting
your username and password, the script will go through each provided cell and transfer
the information to a .txt file which can be directly uploaded to Columbia University's
Courseworks comment section. The script is to be run from the same level as the 
downloaded batch homework folder.
